                <p id="text03">I strongly believe that no technological advancement is 100% culturally neutral. Therefore it is crucial that social awareness is factored into the engineering process. My ultimate goal is to help develop technologies along a safe and ethical path that ensures equity and justice to many parts of the world.</p>
                <p id="text03">On the side, I enjoy hanging out with friends, composing for piano, and playing go.</p>
