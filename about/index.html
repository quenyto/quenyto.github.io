                <p id="text03">Hey there! I'm an fourth-year student at Stanford University studying Mathematics and Electrical Engineering. This Fall, I will begin studying towards a PhD in Electrical Engineering at UCLA, specializing in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>.</p>
                <p id="text03">Born and raised in the Los Angeles Metro area, I grew up in a bilingual Peruvian-American household. My ancestry is a mix of German-American, Cantonese, and Peruvian mestizo. I spend a lot of time listening to and studying Andean music, and I'm currently learning to play the <em>charango</em>. My other hobbies include hanging out with friends, playing go, trying out new foods, and minimalist aesthetics in general.</p>
