My specialty is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>, the mathematical study of how information can flow through systems. I am particularly interested in the relationship between information theory and computer security. My hobbies include playing the charango, trying new foods, and minimalist aesthetics in general.</p>
